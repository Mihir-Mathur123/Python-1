        "Python is one of the most popular programming languages today, and thatâ€™s largely due to several key features that make it easy to learn, powerful, and versatile. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what makes Python such a go-to language:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Simple and Readable Syntax\n",
        "Python code is clear and close to English, which makes it easier to write and understand.\n",

        "Example: print(\"Hello, world!\") is straightforward compared to more complex syntax in other languages.\n",
        "\n",

        "Python has a lot of libraries like,Panda,NumPy,Django,Flask etc.\n",
